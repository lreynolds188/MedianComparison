# MedianComparison

In the first assignment you learned how to analyse an algorithm experimentally, by implementing it as an executable program, measuring the programâ€™s run-time characteristics, and comparing the results with theoretical predictions for the algorithm. In this assignment you will undertake a similar exercise, but this time the aim is to directly compare two different algorithms that both perform the same function but may have different efficiencies. In particular, you must ensure that both programs are analysed under exactly the same conditions, to ensure that the results are meaningfully comparable. As in the first assignment, you will be required to count the number of basic operations performed, measure execution times, and produce a clear report describing your findings.
This is a group assignment. Each of the two group members should implement one of the two algorithms and is expected to make roughly equal contributions to the ground assignment and will get the same grade.
If you have difficulties finding an assignment partner, you may complete this assignment by yourself. But, the marking criteria for individual works will be the same with those for ground works.
For this assignment, it is not allowed to work in a group of three or more.
